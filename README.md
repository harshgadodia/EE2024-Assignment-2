# EE2024-Assignment-2
This is a manned space flight system. We shall refer to this system as NUSpace. This system sends data periodically to a server known as NUSCloud. NUSpace has three modes of operation: Stationary, Launch and Return modes, and will be transmitting to NUSCloud if certain conditions are met. Additionally, other device interfacing is required for NUSpace, which shall be described in the following pages. The stationary mode is the mode in which the rocket is still in its launchpad. Lauch mode is the mode in which the rocket is launched towards space. Return mode is the mode in which the space shuttle mounted on the rocket is detached and returns to land on earth. It is assumed that the base board is a smaller prototype version of NUSpace, with several output devices to help in the debugging during development. The XBee RF module is assumed to a be a low powered wireless communication device that sends collected data to NUSCloud. Students are required to interface with various devices on the Base Board for data capture and data transmission.
