This is a manned space flight system. 

NUSpace has three modes of operation: Stationary, Launch and Return modes, and will be transmitting to NUSCloud if certain conditions are met. 

The stationary mode is the mode in which the rocket is still in its launchpad. Lauch mode is the mode in which the rocket is launched towards space. Return mode is the mode in which the space shuttle mounted on the rocket is detached and returns to land on earth. 

The XBee RF module is assumed to a be a low powered wireless communication device that sends collected data to NUSCloud.
